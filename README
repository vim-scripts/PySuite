You need vim compiled with python to use these! To test if your vim includes python, use this command:  :python print 'hi'. If you get an error, you don't have python. 

Included scripts are:

- vimp3 - music player for vim (scores, random mode taking scores into account, multiple playlists per file, option to pause between tracks; note: other scripts will work in win/linux, this one is only for linux)
- outliner similar to TVO
- todo list manager
- project manager (load/unload by dir/project, make an outline of python files, etc)
- calendar that supports adding notes to dates
- plugin to track expenses and balances
- sortable table with fields separated by 2+ spaces
- resize - set a list of main vim window sizes and use two shortcuts to resize -/+
- helpgrep - enter a few words and use :helpgrep cmd to search for them in any order
- pystripdoc - make a copy of buffer with stripped out python docstrings and comments
- pyfolddoc - fold python docstrings and comments
- aligncode - align code by '=' or '#' chars
