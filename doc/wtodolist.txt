    WTodo list plugin
---------------------

Shortcuts are set up at the top of plugin/wtodolist.vim. You can see a list of
default by hitting '?' in todo list window.


    Quickstart
--------------

:e list.todo
Press N and enter task name three times.

Here's what you should see:

 Name       Project  Priority  Diff  Done  OnHold  Started
------------------------------------------------------------
 Task1               0         0     0     No      Sat Jun 5
 Task2               0         0     0     No      Sat Jun 5
 Task3               0         0     0     No      Sat Jun 5

Set priority of two of them to different numbers and press Enter to sort.

If cursor is positioned on any of the headers, sorting will follow that
category; otherwise sorting defaults to priority.

Let's try marking one task as done and setting another on hold, and then
sorting again:

Press Space, down, then `H`, then Enter. Here is the end result:

Name    Project  Priority  Diff  Done  OnHold  Started
---------------------------------------------------------
 Task2            9         0     0     No      Sat Jun 5

 Task1            2         0     0     Yes     Sat Jun 5

 Task3            0         0     100   No      Sat Jun 5

Tasks are grouped in 3 sections: active, onhold and finished.


    Tips
--------

    - Hit '?' in todo window - there are some commands not covered here.

    - tasks should not have trailing spaces, otherwise putting on hold /
      marking done will not work right. Sorting will remove trailing spaces.
      One space is ok, 2+ is a problem.

    - you can add project name to any task. It does not have to be aligned
      perfectly with the header, it's enough if there are two or more spaces
      separating columns.

    - You can change text in any cell by editing it directly with vim
      commands. Use the 'R' or 'r' to keep alignment intact.

    - You can change divider to anything but all tasks should start from 3rd
      line.

    - 'Diff' header is for 'difficulty'. It will be sorted numerically like
      priority.

    - OnHold command toggles task on / off hold; done command only sets them
      to 100 complete.

    - Sorting is also useful to re-align columns and refresh view e.g. if you
      enter a very long project name.
