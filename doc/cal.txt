    Cal - calendar vim plugin
-----------------------------

    Quickstart
--------------

Create a .cal file, use '\n' to add months (you can use it again at any later time); you can add
short notes in calendar view using vim R command, use '\t' command to go to, and highlight current
day.

Position a cursor on the date number in calendar view and hit enter to create an entry for that
day. Once you're done typing that entry, use '\b' to go back to calendar view. '\h' command will
print the help listing.
