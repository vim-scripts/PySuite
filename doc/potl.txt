    Potl - outliner for Vim
---------------------------

This plugin was inspired by the excellent TVO. I was interested in doing
something more lightweight, small and quick and in python. I also wanted to
avoid using '|' characters for text areas.

Please open doc.potl for the rest of documentation.
