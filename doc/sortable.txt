    Sortable table plugin
-------------------------

This plugin will let you sort a table by any column. Data type (alphanumeric
or numeric) is automatically detected. Data fields are separated by two or
more spaces and must not be empty.  Headers must be single word.

The file with the table should have extension ".ts".

The sorting is done by placing cursor on a header and pressing Enter. Here's
an example layout, sorted by 2nd column:

h1   h2    h3
-------------
c    1     3
a    2.3   a
b    3     1
b    100   .


Headers must be one the first line and 2nd line is reserved for the divider
line, everything after that will be sorted.
